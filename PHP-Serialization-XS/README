PHP-Serialization-XS version 0.01
=================================

This module provides the same interface as PHP::Serialization, but
uses XS during deserialization, for speed enhancement.

If you have code written for PHP::Serialization, you should be able to
replace all references to PHP::Serialization with PHP::Serialization::XS
and notice no change except for an increase in speed of deserialization.

Node that serialization is still provided by PHP::Serialization, and its
speed should therefore not be affected. This is why
PHP::Serialization::XS requires PHP::Serialization to be installed.
